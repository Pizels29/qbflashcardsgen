## Why carding matters in Quizbowl

If you want to actually improve at Quizbowl, you need to **card**.

Strong players don’t just read questions — they convert knowledge into **retrievable memory** using spaced repetition. Flashcards train your brain to recognize clues faster and recall answers under pressure.

Carding helps you:
- Recognize **early clues** faster  
- Lock in **important answers, names, and concepts**  
- Build long-term recall instead of short-term familiarity  
- Improve both **speed and depth** of buzzing  

This tool removes the annoying manual work so you can focus on what actually matters: **studying and getting better.**

## What this project does

QBReader Flashcard CSV Generator is a tiny web tool that converts QBReader `.txt` exports into a clean **2-column CSV** for flashcard apps.

- **Front of card:** first sentence of the question  
- **Back of card:** full answer line  

You can import the CSV into:
- Quizlet  
- Anki  
- Notion  
- RemNote  
- Any platform that supports CSV flashcards  

Everything runs **locally in your browser**. No servers. No tracking.
